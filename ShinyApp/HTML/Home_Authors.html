    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>  
Many ecological studies examine health outcomes and disparities using administrative boundaries such as census tracts, counties, or states. These boundaries help us to understand the patterning of health by place along with impacts of policies implemented at these levels. However, additional geo-political units, or units with both geographic and political meaning, such as congressional districts, present further opportunities to connect research with public policy. As a case study in how to conduct a disparities-focused analysis at the congressional district level, we use geocoded vital statistics data from 2010-2015 to examine levels and disparities of infant mortality (IM) and deaths of despair (DoD) in the 19 U.S. congressional districts of Pennsylvania for the 111th-112th (2009-2012) Congresses, and 18 districts for the 113th-114th (2013-2016) Congresses. We provide recommendations for extending this approach to additional outcomes, states, and geopolitical boundaries such as state legislative districts. Increased surveillance of health outcomes at the congressional district level can help prompt policy action, advocacy, and hopefully, reduce rates and disparities in health.
