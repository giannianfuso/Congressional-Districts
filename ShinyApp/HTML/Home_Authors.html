    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>  
Most descriptive and causal epidemiology examines health outcomes and disparities using administrative boundaries such as census tracts, counties, or states. These boundaries help us understand the patterning of health by place, and impacts of policies implemented at these levels. However, additional geo-political units, or units with both geographic and political meaning, such as congressional districts, present additional opportunities to conduct research with potential policy impact. Using vital statistics data from 2010-2015 we conduct a replicable case study examining levels and disparities of infant mortality and deaths of despair in congressional districts in Pennsylvania for congresses 2012-2015, congresses before and after the 2010 redistricting. We find substantial variation in the congressional district boundaries, and populations and census tracts covered, across Congresses, as well as substantial variation in rates and disparities by congressional district. Our approach can be replicated for additional outcomes and states, and we provide guidance on best practices for extending this approach to additional outcomes, states, and geopolitical boundaries such as state legislative districts. Increased visibility into health outcomes at the congressional district level can help prompt policy action, advocacy, and hopefully, reduce rates and disparities in health.
